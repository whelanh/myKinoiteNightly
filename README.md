### myKinoiteNightly &nbsp; [![bluebuild build badge](https://github.com/whelanh/myKinoiteNightly/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/whelanh/myKinoiteNightly/actions/workflows/build.yml)
*The leading edge of Fedora and KDE...with the safe rollback option built into Kinoite.*

See the [BlueBuild docs](https://blue-build.org/how-to/setup/) for quick setup instructions for setting up your own repository based on this template.

## My Custom Image

This repository builds a custom **Fedora Kinoite image based on the nightly rawhide build**:

   
      Image base:quay.io/fedora-ostree-desktops/kinoite-nightly:rawhide
   
## Changes

The nightly Kinoite build images use the COPR solopasha git repos for the latest in-development KDE and KDE-gear packages. *See https://tim.siosm.fr/blog/2023/01/20/introducing-kinoite-nightly-beta/ for further details.* This custom image also incorporates a number of Universal Blue packages in order to provide some of the features of a UBlue "dx" experience.  See `/recipes/recipe-nvidia.yml` file for details on what I've added.

This image also includes some custom ujust 'recipes' to install a curated list of flatpaks if desired.  See `/files/system/usr/share/ublue-os/just/60-custom.just` for the list of flatpaks. 

### Additional available ujust commands provided

- `ujust auto-setup-flatpaks` - Automatically install all development Flatpaks on first log in (*This is disabled currently*)
- `ujust install-dev-flatpaks` - Manually install all development Flatpaks
- `ujust remove-dev-flatpaks` - Remove all development Flatpaks (keeps user data)
- `ujust list-dev-flatpaks` - Show installation status of all development Flatpaks

### NVIDIA

This image includes a set of packages that should detect your NVIDIA GPU and use the appropriate driver (newer NVIDIA GPUs that can use the nouveau driver).

- `kernel-modules`
- `kernel-modules-extra`
- `linux-firmware`
- `mesa-dri-drivers`
- `xorg-x11-drv-nouveau`
- `libdrm` 

## Installation

> [!WARNING]  
> [This is an experimental feature](https://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable), try at your own discretion.

To rebase an existing atomic Fedora installation to the latest build:

- First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:

    ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/whelanh/kinoite-nightly-ublue:latest
  ```

- Reboot to complete the rebase:
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```
- Then rebase to the signed image, like so:

  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/whelanh/kinoite-nightly-ublue:latest
  ```
- Reboot again to complete the installation
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```

The `latest` tag will automatically point to the latest build. That build will still always use the Fedora version specified in `recipe.yml` (which is the nightly kinoite:rawhide).

## ISO

If build on Fedora Atomic, you can generate an offline ISO with the instructions available [here](https://blue-build.org/learn/universal-blue/#fresh-install-from-an-iso). These ISOs cannot unfortunately be distributed on GitHub for free due to large sizes, so for public projects something else has to be used for hosting.

## Verification

These images are signed with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)'s [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign). You can verify the signature by downloading the `cosign.pub` file from this repo and running the following command:

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/whelanh/myKinoite-amd:latest
```

## Gratitude

I sincerely appreciate all of the hard work by **BlueBuild**, **Fedora** and **Universal Blue** that made this image possible. In particular, to **Universal Blue** for making a number of their packages available on the COPR repository.
